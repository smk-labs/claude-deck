# claude-sync: make local Claude Code sessions visible across all your
# Claude Desktop accounts on this PC.
#
# Claude Desktop keeps a separate Claude Code session index per account+org
# (one <account-uuid>\<org-uuid> folder under
# %APPDATA%\Claude\claude-code-sessions, small local_*.json files). Switch
# account or org and your session list looks empty, even though every
# transcript is still on disk in ~\.claude\projects.
#
# v4 (Windows) fixes this STRUCTURALLY instead of copying files around:
#   - UNIFY (one-time, needs Claude fully closed): the union of every
#     <account>\<org>'s local_*.json moves into one real folder,
#     claude-code-sessions\_shared, and every <account>\<org> folder is
#     replaced by a directory junction to _shared. One physical list;
#     every account and org reads and writes the same files; new sessions
#     appear everywhere instantly; nothing is ever copied again.
#     Union conflicts resolve like v3 did: newest lastActivityAt wins,
#     archived-in-one means archived-everywhere. The whole tree is
#     backed up first (junction-aware) and -Revert restores it fully.
#   - SELF-HEAL (every run, safe with Claude open): scans every transcript
#     in ~\.claude\projects and, for any session that has a transcript but
#     no list entry in _shared (the app sometimes never writes one after a
#     restart or a rewound session), generates a minimal entry from the
#     transcript itself (title from the first user message or the recorded
#     custom title; cwd, timestamps and model read from the transcript).
#     Existing entries are never edited; transcripts are never touched. A
#     heal ledger (heal-ledger.tsv) remembers every session id ever listed,
#     so an entry the user deletes in the app is never resurrected from its
#     transcript. The ONLY entry ever deleted is one self-heal wrote itself
#     that the app has since replaced with its own copy of the same
#     conversation (heal-made.tsv is the record of what we wrote; the app's
#     copy always survives). Without that the chat shows up twice, and an
#     archived one looks un-archived, because our copy carries isArchived
#     false while the app's carries the real flag.
#   - NEWCOMERS: when the app later creates a fresh real <account>\<org>
#     folder (first login of a new account/org), the next run with Claude
#     closed absorbs its entries into _shared and junctions it too.
#   - ARCHIVE REPLAY (every run, safe with Claude open): current MSIX
#     builds of Claude Desktop log every archive/unarchive to their
#     main.log but fail to persist the isArchived flag into the session
#     index, so the whole cleanup silently reverts on the next launch
#     (verified 2026-07-21: the archive action produces log lines and
#     zero index writes; the app also re-asserts stale entries from
#     memory within seconds if a loaded entry changes under it). Every
#     run therefore tails each profile's main.log (offsets kept in
#     archive-log-offsets.tsv), turns "Archived/Unarchived session
#     local_*" lines into intents (archive-intents.tsv, newest event per
#     id wins), and applies any intent the index disagrees with. Applied
#     -and-stable intents are dropped; intents whose entry is gone are
#     dropped (deletes are never resurrected); intents expire after 14
#     days. Flag writes are backed up into the run manifest, so -Revert
#     undoes them too. The watcher also tails the logs, so an archive
#     lands in the index seconds after you click it, restart-proof.
# The v3 copy machinery (winner distribution, deletion ledger) is gone for
# sessions: with one physical list there is nothing to reconcile and a
# delete in the app is already a delete everywhere. ledger.tsv is read one
# last time during UNIFY (its ids seed the heal ledger, so sessions deleted
# after their last full v3 sync are not resurrected) and never written
# again. The macOS script (claude-sync.sh) still implements the v3 copy
# design; this junction design is Windows-only for now.
#
# It also syncs customization across PROFILES: multi-profile launchers
# (claude-deck) give each profile its own data dir under
# %APPDATA%\Claude Profiles\<name>\, so local MCP servers (the mcpServers
# block of claude_desktop_config.json) and installed Desktop Extensions
# diverge per profile. Every sync reconciles mcpServers across all data
# dirs: missing servers are added everywhere, and when two profiles define
# the SAME server differently, the definition from the config file with the
# newest EFFECTIVE mtime wins and overwrites the others (edit a server in
# any profile, it propagates). A REMOVAL needs a witness: the name goes
# everywhere only when some config C (a) is recorded in mcp-ledger.tsv as
# having held it, (b) does not hold it now, (c) still holds at least one
# other server, and (d) did not lose several servers at once. The ledger is
# PER CONFIG ("cfgPath<TAB>serverName" rows), which is what makes "the user
# deleted it here" distinguishable from "this profile never had it": the
# older flat ledger of bare names could not tell them apart, so one fresh
# profile holding a single auto-registered server wiped every server from
# every profile on 2026-07-23 (7 servers x 10 profiles here).
# Rule (d) is what tells a deletion from a STALE WRITEBACK: a running
# Claude Desktop holds its config in memory from launch and rewrites the
# whole file later, silently dropping every server added since, which on
# disk is indistinguishable from a bulk delete (it wiped eight servers
# across eleven configs on macOS on 2026-07-27). Servers are deleted one at
# a time through the UI, so a config losing CLAUDE_SYNC_MCP_RESET_MIN (2)
# or more of its ledgered servers in ONE run votes for nothing and wins no
# conflict in EITHER block (its contents are old by definition even though
# its file mtime is the newest on disk), while the ordinary union-add path
# refills it on the same run. -NoDeletes skips (and thereby restores) all
# removals.
# The app's own settings (the "preferences" block: bypass-permissions,
# scheduled tasks, sidebar mode, ...) are reconciled the same way, but
# ADD-ONLY: a key present anywhere is propagated everywhere, nothing is
# ever removed, and on a conflict the newest effective mtime wins, so the
# last change you made is the one that spreads. The per-account maps
# (*ByAccount) merge entry by entry (also by effective mtime), so turning a
# setting on for one account never drops another account's entry. A profile
# that has never been opened has no preferences of its own and therefore
# can never blank a setting for the rest -- the failure mode the MCP ledger
# guards against.
# Every other key of each config file is untouched. Extensions stay
# copy-only (additive). Config writes are backed up into the run's
# manifest, so -Revert undoes them too. (No claude-deck profiles on this
# machine yet? The whole layer is dormant and costs nothing.)
# Logins and cookies are deliberately never synced: separate accounts are
# the whole point of profiles. Per-profile window/workspace state (the
# launchPreview* lists) is left alone for the same reason. Claude Code
# customization (plugins, skills, hooks, memory in ~\.claude) is already
# machine-global and needs no syncing.
#
# Deliberately NOT synced either: %APPDATA%\Claude\local-agent-mode-sessions
# (a parallel index tree that appeared in mid-2026 builds). Its semantics
# are unknown; restructuring it blindly could corrupt agent state.
# Revisit once Claude ships whatever it is for.
#
# Safety notes for the structural work (learned the hard way elsewhere):
#   - A junction is removed with the non-recursive Directory.Delete (or an
#     rmdir), NEVER Remove-Item -Recurse: recursing through a reparse point
#     deletes the TARGET's contents, i.e. the shared index itself.
#   - Restructure and structural revert refuse to run while Claude Desktop
#     is up. Detection is by ExecutablePath (MSIX \WindowsApps\Claude_* or
#     legacy Squirrel \AnthropicClaude\app-*), never by process name: the
#     Claude Code CLI is also a claude.exe and must not count.
#   - Existing list files are only ever regex-scanned, never JSON-parsed:
#     real files exist whose enabledMcpTools map has case-colliding keys
#     that ConvertFrom-Json rejects.
#
# JSON handling uses PowerShell's built-in ConvertFrom-Json/ConvertTo-Json:
# no dependencies. Works on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7+.

claude-sync v$ScriptVersion
One shared Claude Code session list for every Claude Desktop account and
org on this PC, plus customization sync (MCP servers, preferences,
Desktop Extensions) across claude-deck profiles.

Sessions work structurally since v4 (Windows): a one-time restructure
(needs Claude fully closed) moves the union of every <account>\<org>
index into claude-code-sessions\_shared and replaces the org folders
with directory junctions to it. After that there is one physical list:
new sessions appear under every account instantly, a delete in the app
is a delete everywhere, nothing is copied on a schedule. Every run also
self-heals: a session whose transcript exists but whose list entry was
never written (app restart, rewound session) gets a minimal entry
generated from the transcript. Existing entries are never edited;
transcripts are never touched; deletes are never resurrected (tracked
in heal-ledger.tsv). The only entry ever deleted is a self-heal copy the
app has since replaced with its own (heal-made.tsv records what we
wrote), which is what used to show one chat twice. The restructure backs
up the whole tree first and -Revert restores it completely (also only
with Claude closed).

Customization syncs across claude-deck profiles too: MCP servers, app
settings (the preferences block) and Desktop Extensions. The newest
change wins a conflict, settings are add-only, and an MCP removal
propagates only when mcp-ledger.tsv can name the config that lost it.
A config that lost two or more servers at once is read as a stale
Claude Desktop writeback instead: it decides nothing that run and is
refilled from the others (CLAUDE_SYNC_MCP_RESET_MIN raises the two).

Usage: claude-sync [command]   (--gnu-style spellings work too)

  (no command)     Run the sync. With Claude closed: restructure (first
                   run), then self-heal. With Claude open: self-heal only;
                   the restructure waits and says so.
  -DryRun          Show everything a run would do, write nothing.
  -NoDeletes       MCP servers only: skip removal propagation (and thereby
                   restore a server deleted on one side). Sessions no
                   longer need it: one physical list has no copies to
                   reconcile.
  -Revert          Undo the most recent run from its backup. A run that
                   restructured the tree restores it fully (Claude must
                   be closed for that).
  -Status          Show tree state, entry counts, per-profile MCP and
                   settings counts, ledger sizes, install state.
  -Install         Copy this script to ~\.claude\scripts\ and register the
                   'claude-sync' command in your PowerShell profile.
                   Re-run to update.
  -Uninstall       Remove the command and the auto-sync task (if enabled).
  -AutoInstall     Auto-sync every time Claude Desktop quits (per-user
                   Scheduled Task, no admin rights).
  -AutoUninstall   Disable auto-sync.
  -Version         Print version.
  -Help            This text.

First run: close Claude Desktop fully, run claude-sync once, reopen.
Everything after that can run anytime (self-heal is safe with the app
open; structural changes simply wait for a closed app).
