# claude-sync: make local Claude Code sessions visible across all your
# Claude Desktop accounts on this Mac.
#
# Claude Desktop keeps a separate Claude Code session list per account+org
# (one <accountUuid>/<orgUuid> folder of local_*.json entries under
# ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude-code-sessions). Switch
# accounts and your session list looks empty, even though every transcript
# is still on disk in ~/.claude/projects.
#
# v4 fixes that structurally instead of copying files around:
#   - UNIFY: one physical list at claude-code-sessions/_shared; every
#     <account>/<org> folder becomes a symlink to it. Each list entry
#     exists once, every account sees it, and a new session written by the
#     app lands in _shared and appears everywhere instantly. The one-time
#     restructure (and absorbing any fresh real folder the app creates
#     later) runs only while Claude Desktop is fully closed, after a
#     whole-tree backup; --revert restores the tree verbatim.
#   - SELF-HEAL: the app sometimes never writes a list entry for a session
#     (seen after restarts and rewound sessions), so it vanishes from the
#     list although its transcript is intact. Every run scans
#     ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl and recreates a missing entry from the
#     transcript itself (custom title or first user message; cwd, model
#     and timestamps from the transcript). "Missing" is judged against
#     entry file names AND each entry's inner cliSessionId AND the heal
#     ledger of everything ever listed, so app-created entries are never
#     duplicated and an entry deleted in the app is never resurrected.
#     Entries are never edited, and the ONLY entry ever deleted is one
#     self-heal wrote itself that the app has since replaced with its own
#     copy of the same conversation (heal-made.tsv is the record of what we
#     wrote; the app's copy always survives). Without that the chat shows
#     up twice, and an archived one looks un-archived, because our copy
#     carries isArchived false while the app's carries the real flag.
#     Transcripts are only ever read.
#
# It also syncs customization across PROFILES: multi-profile launchers
# (claude-deck) give each profile its own data dir under
# ~/Library/Application Support/Claude Profiles/<name>/, so both blocks of
# claude_desktop_config.json that matter, mcpServers and preferences (the
# app settings: bypassPermissions and friends), diverge per profile, as do
# installed Desktop Extensions. Every sync reconciles both blocks across
# all data dirs in one pass:
#   - MCP servers: missing ones are added everywhere; when two profiles
#     define the SAME server differently the newest-mtime config wins;
#     a removal propagates only when some config is RECORDED IN THE LEDGER
#     as having held that server, does not hold it now, still holds
#     others, and lost only that one server this run. The ledger is per
#     config, which is what makes "the user deleted it here"
#     distinguishable from "this profile never had it" (the v3 global
#     ledger could not tell them apart, and one fresh profile therefore
#     wiped every server on 2026-07-23 on Windows and 2026-07-26 here).
#     The one-at-a-time rule is what tells a deletion from a STALE
#     WRITEBACK: a running Claude Desktop holds its config in memory from
#     launch and rewrites the whole file later, silently dropping every
#     server added since, which looks identical to a bulk delete (it wiped
#     eight servers across eleven configs on 2026-07-27).
#     --no-deletes skips (and thereby restores) removals.
#   - Settings (preferences): add-only. A key set in any profile spreads to
#     all of them, newest change wins a conflict, *ByAccount maps merge
#     entry by entry so no account's opt-in is dropped, per-profile window
#     state (launchPreview*) is left alone, and nothing is ever deleted.
# Every other key of each config file is untouched. Extensions stay
# copy-only (additive). Config writes are backed up into the run's
# manifest, so --revert undoes them too.
# Deliberately never synced: logins and cookies (separate accounts are the
# whole point of profiles), and config.json, which holds the profile's
# oauth token cache and per-account app state next to a few UI keys.
# Claude Code customization (plugins, skills, hooks, memory, settings.json
# in ~/.claude) is already machine-global: every profile reads the same
# files, so there is nothing to sync. Session dirs inside profiles are
# claude-deck's job (it symlinks them to the shared one), not ours.
#
# Compatible with the stock macOS /bin/bash (3.2). No dependencies
# (JSON merging runs in macOS's built-in osascript JavaScript runtime).

#   argv: [0] "plan"|"write"  [1] "deletes"|"nodeletes"  [2] ledger path
#         [3] reset-min  [4..] cfg-path, mtime pairs (default root first).
#
# mcpServers, per server name across all configs:
#   - definitions differ -> the newest-mtime config wins and overwrites the
#     rest (tie: the default root, listed first, wins),
#   - name missing from a config -> added there,
#   - REMOVAL needs a witness: the name is removed everywhere only when some
#     config C (a) is recorded in the ledger as having held it, (b) does
#     not hold it now, (c) still holds at least one other server, and
#     (d) is not STALE (below). That is the only state that means "the user
#     deleted it there".
#     The ledger is therefore PER CONFIG (path<TAB>name rows), not one
#     global set: a global set cannot tell "this profile never had it" from
#     "this profile lost it", which is how a single fresh profile wiped
#     every server on Windows (2026-07-23) and on this Mac (2026-07-26,
#     nine servers across ten configs, v3 script). A profile that has never
#     synced has no ledger rows and can never vote; a config the app reset
#     to zero servers is excluded by (c). --no-deletes drops rule (a)-(d)
#     entirely: nothing is removed and the missing copies are re-added,
#     which is exactly the restore path.
#   - STALE (rule d, the 2026-07-27 fix): a config missing RESET_MIN or more
#     of its ledgered servers AT ONCE did not lose them to a person. Servers
#     are deleted one at a time through the UI; losing several in one run is
#     the signature of a Claude Desktop instance that has been open since
#     before those servers existed and has just rewritten the whole file
#     from its stale in-memory copy. Such a config votes for nothing and
#     wins no conflict in EITHER block (its contents are old by definition),
#     while the ordinary union-add path puts every missing server back on
#     the same run. Cost of the guard being wrong: a genuine bulk delete
#     comes back and has to be repeated one server at a time. Cost of not
#     having it: every server on the machine disappears from every account.
#
# preferences (the app settings block: bypassPermissions and friends),
# ADD-ONLY on purpose, so a profile that was never opened can never blank a
# setting for the rest:
#   - a key present in any config is propagated to all of them,
#   - genuine conflict -> newest-mtime config wins ("my last change wins"),
#   - *ByAccount maps merge entry by entry, newest mtime per account: the
#     flags are keyed by account UUID, so copying the block verbatim would
#     drop other accounts opt-ins and leave the setting inert in the
#     profile whose own account was missing,
#   - per-profile window state (launchPreview*) is never touched,
#   - nothing is ever deleted from preferences.

# ---------- session list: one shared list + self-heal ---------------------
# v4 replaced the copy-everywhere session sync with a symlink design:
#   claude-code-sessions/_shared/          one physical set of local_*.json
#   <account>/<org>  ->  ../_shared        every subfolder is a symlink
# Every account/org sees the same list, a new session written by the app
# lands in _shared and appears everywhere instantly, and there is nothing
# left to reconcile (the v2/v3 winner/ledger/deletion machinery is gone).
# The self-heal step then recreates list entries the app lost: any
# transcript in ~/.claude/projects with no matching entry gets one
# generated from the transcript itself. Entries are never edited or
# deleted; transcripts are only ever read.
#
# v4.1 ports the lessons of the Windows v4 migration (the same design
# shipped there first and hit real data bugs within days):
#   - an app-created entry is named after the app's OWN session id and
#     carries the transcript id inside as cliSessionId, so "already
#     listed" must match BOTH, or every app-saved chat gets healed into a
#     duplicate (674 of 715 entries on this machine have differing ids);
#   - heal-ledger.tsv remembers every id ever listed, so an entry the
#     user deleted in the app is never resurrected from its transcript;
#     ids from the old v3 ledger.tsv seed it (an id there with no entry
#     now was deleted post-sync);
#   - transcripts are healed only when they are real conversations: UUID
#     filename, not a sidechain, and a usable title (custom title, first
#     user message, or summary);
#   - a config entry can be pretty-printed by the app ("isArchived": x),
#     so every field read tolerates both serializations;
#   - absorbing an org folder ORs the archived flag across copies (v3
#     semantics: archived-in-one means archived), verifies every file
#     landed in _shared before the folder is removed, leaves any folder
#     with unexpected content real (reported, never forced), and a hard
#     failure mid-restructure auto-restores the whole tree from this
#     run's backup.
# The Windows archive-replay subsystem (tailing the app's main.log) is
# deliberately NOT ported: it works around an MSIX packaging bug where
# the app logs archive clicks but never persists the flag. On macOS the
# flag demonstrably persists (verified 2026-07-23 across four profiles:
# the newest logged archive event and the entry on disk agree). If a
# macOS build ever ships the same bug, port Invoke-ArchiveReplay from
# claude-sync.ps1.
#
# Intermediate state lives in $WORK_DIR (a mktemp dir, removed on exit):
#   real_orgs.tsv   account<TAB>orgPath   (org dirs still needing absorb)
#   listed_ids.txt  ids already listed (file names + cliSessionId values)
#   seen_ids.txt    heal-ledger ids + v3-ledger ids (tombstones)
#   heal_list.txt   transcript paths needing a regenerated entry
# Paths contain spaces ("Application Support") but never tabs or newlines,
# so TSV is a safe interchange format as long as every expansion is quoted.

# listing one transcript path per line. Per transcript, from the first
# ~250 lines: cwd, createdAt, model, and the title (a recorded custom
# title wins; else the first real user message, with command wrappers,
# "Caveat:" preambles, interrupted-request markers and isMeta rows
# skipped; else the recorded summary); from the tail chunk: the last
# timestamp and any late custom-title rename. Sidechain transcripts and
# transcripts with no usable title are skipped, mirroring the Windows
# implementation. "write" creates _shared/local_<id>.json compact, no
# trailing newline, exactly like the app's own files, stamps the file
# mtime with lastActivityAt, and refuses to overwrite an existing entry.

claude-sync v$VERSION
One shared Claude Code session list for all Claude Desktop accounts: every
<account>/<org> folder under claude-code-sessions is a symlink to one
_shared folder, so each conversation exists once and every account sees
it. Each run also self-heals the list: a transcript in ~/.claude/projects
with no list entry gets one regenerated (the app sometimes loses entries
after restarts or rewound sessions). Existing entries are never edited or
deleted; transcripts are never touched. Customization also syncs across
profiles (claude-deck): MCP servers and app settings (the preferences
block: bypassPermissions and friends) are reconciled in every run. A
server or setting changed in one profile propagates, the newest change
wins a conflict, settings are add-only, and an MCP removal propagates
only when a config the ledger saw holding that server lost it (skip with
--no-deletes). Logins, cookies and config.json are never touched.

Usage: claude-sync [command]

  (no command)       Run the sync. The one-time restructure into _shared
                     needs Claude Desktop fully closed; the script stops
                     with a message if it is running.
  --dry-run          Show what a sync would do, write nothing.
  --no-deletes       Sync WITHOUT propagating MCP server removals; a server
                     deleted in one profile is copied back instead (the
                     restore path for an accidental removal).
  --revert           Undo the most recent sync run from its backup. If that
                     run restructured the session tree, this restores the
                     whole tree exactly as it was (Claude must be closed).
  --status           Show unify state, entry counts, per-profile MCP and
                     settings counts, install state.
  --install          Copy this script to ~/.claude/scripts/ and register the
                     'claude-sync' alias in ~/.zshrc. Re-run to update.
  --uninstall        Remove the alias and the auto-sync agent (if enabled).
  --auto-install     Auto-sync whenever new conversations appear: a
                     LaunchAgent watches ~/.claude/projects and syncs
                     after 8s of write silence, at most once per 45s.
  --auto-uninstall   Disable auto-sync.
  --version          Print version.
  --help             This text.

First run: quit Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q, every profile), then run
claude-sync. It backs up the whole claude-code-sessions tree, moves the
union of all list entries into _shared, and symlinks every account/org
folder to it. After that, runs are maintenance only (absorb new account
folders, regenerate lost entries) and are safe anytime.
